# Compilation errors

Swiftâ€™s compile errors can be mystifying if you are not intimately familiar with
the internals of Argo. Here we describe some of the most common errors and how
to fix them.

## Complex expressions

Considering that the implementation of `decode` on a model consists of fully
currying a method and composing it with many small pieces, each of which may be
the composition of pieces, it is not surprising that Swift sometimes has
difficulty compiling the expression in a reasonable amount of time. This
manifests itself with the following error:

> Expression was too complex to be solved in reasonable time; consider
> breaking up the expression into distinct sub-expressions.

Fortunately this is easy to solve. A first step is to store
`curry(Model.init)` in a variable instead of using it directly:

```swift
static func decode(j: JSON) -> Decoded<Model> {
  let create = Curry(Model.init)
  return create
    <^> j <| "key1"
    <*> j <| "key2"
    ...
```

Many times this can fix the problem. If you still have complex expression
issues, the next step is to pick a midpoint in your decoding chain and set an
intermediate variable:

```swift
static func decode(j: JSON) -> Decoded<Model> {
  let create = Curry(Model.init)
  let tmp = create
    <^> j <| "key_a_1"
    <*> j <| "key_a_2"
    ...
  return tmp
    <*> j <| "key_b_1"
    <*> j <| "key_b_2"
    ...
```

This should almost surely fix all of your complex expression issues, but if not,
be prepared to try one more intermediate variable. Take careful note that in
defining `tmp` we used the map operator `create <^>` but in the return statement
we used the applicative operator `tmp <*>`. The map operator is _only_ used with
the fully curried `init`.

## Incorrectly decoded fields

When you have not correctly decoded all fields of your model in the `decode`
function you will see an error of the form:

> Cannot invoke 'curry' with an argument list of type 'A -> B -> C'

> Cannot convert value of type 'A -> B -> C' to expected argument type '_ -> _
> -> C'

The latter happens when you are returning `curry(Model.init)` directly, and the
former happens when you have stored `curry(Model.init)` in a variable instead of
returning directly. See the discussion on complex expressions for more
information on why one would do that.

There are a few ways in which you may not have correctly decoded your model:

 * You are missing a `j <| "key"` for a field in your model.
 * You incorrectly decoded the type of a field, e.g. you used `j <|
   "optional_key"` when you meant `j <|? "optional_key"`.

The best way forward is to re-examine all of the fields in your model and make
sure they are accounted for in `decode` and that types match up.

## Misuse of functional operators

When you have misused the map `<^>` or applicative `<*>` operators you will see
errors that mention the `Decoded` type. One such kind of error is:

> No 'curry' candidates produce the expected contextual result type 'Decoded<_
> -> _ -> _ -> C>'

> Cannot convert value of type 'A -> B -> C' to type 'Decoded<_ -> _ -> C>'

The key difference in these errors from the previous is the mention of
`Decoded<>` on the right side. This most likely means that you are using `<*>`
when you should be using `<^>`:

```swift
static func decode(j: JSON) -> Decoded<Model> {
  return Curry(Model.init)
    <^> j <| "key1" // <-- Good
    <*> j <| "key2"
    ...
}

static func decode(j: JSON) -> Decoded<Model> {
  return Curry(Model.init)
    <*> j <| "key1" // <-- Bad
    <*> j <| "key2"
    ...
}
```

Simply put, the map operator `<^>` should only be used to the right of the fully
curried function, as it represents the first step of trying to plug a decoded
value into `Model.init`.

Another misuse of the functional operators comes in the form of the following
error:

> Cannot convert call result type 'Decoded<_>' to expected type '@noescape _
> -> _ -> C'

Now we see that `Decoded<>` is mentioned on the left. This happens when you have
used the map operator `<^>` instead of the applicative operator `<*>`:

```swift
static func decode(j: JSON) -> Decoded<Model> {
  return Curry(Model.init)
    <^> j <| "key1"
    <*> j <| "key2" // <-- Good
    ...
}

static func decode(j: JSON) -> Decoded<Model> {
  return Curry(Model.init)
    <^> j <| "key1"
    <^> j <| "key2" // <-- Bad
    ...
}
```
